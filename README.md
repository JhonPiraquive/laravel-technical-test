# Laravel Technical Test

## Description
This is a technical test software designed to evaluate my skills as a senior developer.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your machine.
- [Linux or WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed on your machine.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository, Initializing Docker Containers, and Setup (Step by Step)

To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JhonPiraquive/laravel-technical-test.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to build and start the Docker containers:

```bash
$ cd laravel-technical-test
```

Add your custom values to ROOT_PASSWORD, USERNAME, and PASSWORD variables (This will construct the database container)
```
$ ROOT_PASSWORD= USERNAME= PASSWORD= docker-compose -p app_database -f db-docker-compose.yml up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

Create the .env file
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Replace the following variables in the .env file
```
DB_DATABASE=The database name you set
DB_USERNAME=The database username you set
DB_PASSWORD=The password you set
```

If you want to receive emails configure the following variables (Make sure you have a mailersend account) By default the emails are stored in the laravel.log file, if mailersend is a free trial it will take some time so feel free to use the laravel.log file [Create a Mailersend account](https://www.mailersend.com)
```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailersend.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your smtp username from mailersend
MAIL_PASSWORD=your smtp password from mailersend
MAIL_ENCRYPTION="tls"
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="info@yourtrialdomain"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

This will construct the nginx and php container
```
docker-compose -p app_server up -d --build --remove-orphans
```

Wait a couple of seconds and go to http://localhost

### Executing Migrations and Seeders
The containers will create this for you, just relax and wait! ðŸ˜€

### Accessing the Database
To access the database, you can use a database management tool phpMyAdmin through http://localhost:8080

### Running Tests

You can execute the unit tests using the following commands:

```bash
$ docker exec -it app_php bash
$ php artisan config:cache
$ composer dump-autoload
$ php artisan test
```
